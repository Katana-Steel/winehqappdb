Release under GPLv3 or later license, read the
LICENSE file for the full licensing details

This is an app for Android API-16 (due to flutter) or
newer that will query appdb.winehq.com and list
reported windows applications and diplay their
currently reported versions and how well they
function under wine.

The Wine Database uses different levels for how
well an application works with wine like this:
* Platinum
* Gold
* Silver
* Bronze
* Garbage

see [appdb.winehq.org](https://appdb.winehq.org/help/?sTopic=maintainer_ratings)
for the exact definition of each level.
